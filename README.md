Basically UNO, just with math.<br />
Believe me, it is more fun than it sounds

## Currently implemented
- Handcards
- 2 cards pushable
- 1 card pushable
- cards drawable
- multiple players on multiple devices
- winner is shown
- Host can decide:
  - Max players
  - Starting card count
  - Late players starting card count
  - Max round time
  - If players get humiliated
  - Define winner by
    - Earliest empty hand
    - Most points
- Disconnect from Server
- Get two cards when time's up
- Handcards gray when not players turn
- Cards "glowing" on mouse hover
- Account system with Database

## Current Problems:
- nothing we are currently aware of

## Future ideas:
- Game mode with calculations up to three cards
- Lobby
- Random middle card
- Code instead of IP
  - save code and IP in database, make query on clientside
- Maximum of two failed tries per round
